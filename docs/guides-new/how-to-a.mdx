# How to Send a One-Time Notification

## What is a one-time notification?

A one-time notification is a notification that is sent to your users manually using Courier's UI. This product feature enables a one time send to be crafted and sent to your users in under 5 minutes.
If you need to update your users quickly with a notification, One-Time Send is the tool for you.

## How to use Courier’s One-Time Send feature

Select which channel you’d like to send a notification through. A provider will then automatically be chosen for you. This
selection is only made given that you have configured providers on your account. From here, write your message, and then send the notification immediately or schedule the notification for later.
