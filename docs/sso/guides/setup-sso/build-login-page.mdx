# Add SSO to your Login Page
<Subtitle>Login page UX strategies to accommodate Single Sign-on</Subtitle>

Using our [quickstart](/sso/quickstart) guide, you may already have implemented Single Sign-on between your application and your customer's Identity Provider. In this article, let's look at different login page UX strategies that you can adopt to implement Single Sign-on in your application's login page.

Let's assume that you already let your users log in via email address, password combination or via social providers like Google, GitHub etc.

Broadly, you can adopt one of the following three different strategies to implement Single Sign-on in your login page

## Strategy 1: Identifier driven Single Sign-on
In this strategy, you will first collect the email address of the user and depending on the user's email address, you will determine whether to guide the user to Single Sign-on based authentication or password based authentication.

Depending on your implementation, you can decide to authenticate the user via Single Sign-on based on
1. the domain of the user's email address (or)
2. authentication settings of the organization to which the user belongs to

Biggest advantage in this approach is that users don't have to decide the authentication method and you can do it on their behalf based on the identity(email address) information that they supplied. This improves reduces cognitive load for your users and makes their experience smoother.

Especially in scenarios where users might be logging in using passwords until one day, their admin decides to turn on Single Sign-on option and mandates their users to login only via Single Sign-on and not via password. In this situation, users don't have to change their authentication behaviour but you will do it for them. Popular products like [Google](https://accounts.google.com), [Microsoft](https://login.microsoftonline.com), [AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/) adopted this strategy in their login page implementation.


## Strategy 2: Login with Single Sign-on Button
In this strategy, you will add one more "Login with SSO" button in your login page prompting users to choose this option explicitly. The obvious advantage of this approach is you present all the options available for the user and let the user decide how they want to login to your application.

In this approach, if a user tries to login via password even though their admin mandates their employees to login via Single Sign-on, you should force the users to authentication via Single Sign-on instead of showing an error message thus improving the user experience. Popular products like [Cal.com](https://app.cal.com/auth/login), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/login) adopted this strategy in their login page implementation.

In either of the above strategies, even if a user chooses an authentication method like Social Login, verify the user's identity and if that user is supposed to authenticate via Single Sign-on based on their admin's configuration in your application, you should prompt the user to re-authenticate via Single Sign-on.

## Strategy 3: Tenant specific Login Page
In this strategy, instead of implementing a single login page served at https:<span></span>//app.yoursaas.com/login, you will instead serve different login pages for each tenant. For example, https://<span></span>tenant1.yoursaas.com/login, https://<span></span>tenant2.yoursaas.com/login.

Depending on the login page url that a tenant uses, you can show only those authentication methods that are applicable for that tenant and optimizing the user experience further.

Popular products like [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/in/login/), [Slack](https://scalekit.slack.com/) adopted this strategy in their login page implementation.

One important thing you need to keep in mind with this strategy is, your users need to remember the tenant URL first before they can access their tenant's login page.

## Initiating Single Sign-on from your login page
Once you have decided on the strategy to implement in your login page, let's wire your login page to let your users login using SSO via Scalekit.

Regardless of the strategy you implemented, once you have identified that the user needs to login via Single Sign-on, you can construct the authorization_url via our Scalekit SDK and redirect the user to this url. Refer the code samples below.


<Tabs groupId="tech-stack" queryString>
<TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">

```javascript showLineNumbers
import { Scalekit } from "@scalekit-sdk/node";

// initialize the SDK client
const scalekit = new Scalekit(
  SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL,
  SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID,
  SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET
);

// Option 1: Authorization URL with the organization ID
const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, {
  organizationId: "org_12442",
  state: state, // optional
});

// Option 2: Authorization URL with login hint
const authorizationURL = scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(redirectUri, {
  loginHint: "user@example.com",
});

// TODO: redirect the user to this authorizationURL
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```python showLineNumbers
from scalekit import ScalekitClient, AuthorizationUrlOptions, CodeAuthenticationOptions

scalekit_client = ScalekitClient(
  <SCALEKIT_ENVIRONMENT_URL>,

)

options = AuthorizationUrlOptions()


# Option 1: Authorization URL with the organization ID
options.organization_id = 'org_12442'

# Option 2: Authorization URL with login hint
options.login_hint = '<user@example.com>'

authorization_url = scalekit_client.get_authorization_url(
  redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>,
  options=options
)
```

<TabItem value="golang" label="Go">

```go showLineNumbers

  sc := scalekit.NewScalekitClient(

    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_ID,
    SCALEKIT_CLIENT_SECRET
  )

  options := scalekit.AuthorizationUrlOptions{}
  // use one of the three strategies below to determine how to log the user in.

  // If you would like to authenticate the user via organization_id
  options.OrganizationId = "org_12442"

  // If you would like to authenticate the user via their email address
  // Domain portion of the user's email address is used to detect the appropriate enterprise SSO connection
  options.LoginHint = "<user@example.com>"

  authorizationURL := sc.GetAuthorizationUrl(
    redirectUrl,
    options,
  )
  // next step is to redirect the user to this authorizationURL
}
```
