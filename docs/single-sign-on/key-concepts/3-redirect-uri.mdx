# Redirect URI

A Redirect URI is an endpoint URL to which Scalekit redirects users after they complete authentication with the Identity Provider.

**Configuration Requirements**

- At least one Redirect URI must be configured per environment.
- Multiple Redirect URIs can be configured.
- One Redirect URI must be designated as the default.

The `redirect_uri` parameter is required when initiating the authentication flow. It must match exactly with one of the Redirect URIs configured in the Scalekit dashboard.

:::info

In IdP-initiated SAML SSO Flow, Scalekit uses the Redirect URI marked as default to redirect the user to the application.

## Validation Rules

In both Production and Development Environments:

1. Maximum length: 256 characters
2. Query components are allowed and retained
3. Fragment components are not allowed

**Production Environment**

1. Must begin with `https`
2. Cannot use `localhost`
3. Wildcard characters are not permitted

**Development Environment**

1. Must begin with `http` or `https`
   - `http` is only allowed for `localhost`
2. `localhost` URIs are supported
3. Wildcard characters are allowed, subject to specific rules

## Wildcard Redirect URIs

Wildcard characters (`*`) are permitted **in Development environments**, subject to the following constraints:

1. Not allowed as a root-level domain
2. Limited to one wildcard per URI
3. Must be located in a subdomain within the hostname component
4. Matches only one subdomain in its place

**Examples**

- Allowed: `https://*.acmecorp.com`, `https://saml-auth-*.acmecorp.com`
- Not allowed: `https://*.com`, `https://*.*.acmecorp.com`, `https://xyz.*.com`

**Matching Behavior**

`https://*.acmecorp.com/` will match `https://auth.acmecorp.com` but not `https://saml.auth.acmecorp.com`
