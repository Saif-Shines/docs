# Add SSO to your Login Page

Single Sign-on works by exchanging user information in a secured format between two trusted parties - your application and your customer's identity provider (IdP). Most of these interactions happen in the browser context and some of the authentication steps need user's intervention.

The first step of Single Sign On (SSO) authentication flow takes the users to the Authorization URL before they authenticate with their Identity Provider. In this guide, learn how to build login page of your app that redirects the users of an organization to your staging environment’s Authorization endpoint.

Maximise your understanding of this guide by using it in conjunction with the [scalekit-nextjs-example](https://github.com/scalekit-inc/scalekit-nextjs-example) repository.

## Create a Login Form

Start by creating a page in your web app where users can login. Use any programming language that fits your technology stack. This guide is using NextJS as the framework and along with Typescript and Tailwind.

Consider we want to build a login form that collects user’s email address to initiate a Single Sign On (SSO), it might look like this:

<figure className="width-50">
  ![SSO using
  Email](@site/docs/sso/assets/guides/setup-sso/build-login-page/1-login-box.png)
  <figcaption>Single Sign On using Email</figcaption>
</figure>

A rough code snippet of the same login form.

```tsx title="app/login/page.tsx"
<form className="space-y-6" onSubmit={initiateAuth}>
  <div>
    <label htmlFor="email" className="block text-sm text-gray-600">
      Work Email
    </label>
    <div className="mt-1">
      <input
        type="text"
        name="email"
        id="email"
        placeholder="username@scalekit.com"
        className="text-black block w-full border<<truncated>>"
        value={state.email}
        onChange={handleChange}
        required
      />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button
      type="submit"
      className="px-4 py-2 w-full border borde<<truncated>>"
    >
      Continue with SAML SSO
    </button>
  </div>
</form>
```

The form tracks the users inputs and saves the current state and upon the button click initiates the Authorization — using <SimpleCode>handleChange</SimpleCode> and <SimpleCode>initiateAuth</SimpleCode> methods. Before we continue, next let’s look all the methods you can initiate the authentication flow.

## Choosing Your SSO Authentication Strategy

There are multiple approaches for implementing SSO login in B2B apps. We have seen one approach in the Login Form above where users will continue to log into your B2B app by using their email address.

**Using Email Address:** A familiar and straightforward approach for your users is give in their email address. Based on the domain in their email address, Scalekit will determine the SSO connection required to successfully log in the user.

**Using Organization ID:** Scalekit will choose the SSO connection configured with B2B app based on the <SimpleCode>organization_id</SimpleCode> and initiates the SSO for the users.

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  name="organizationId"
  id="organizationId"
  placeholder="org_1234412"
  className="text-black block w-full <<truncated>>"
  value={state.organizationId}
  onChange={handleChange}
  required
/>
```

**Using Connection ID:** In the cases when your B2B app has only the <SimpleCode>connection_id</SimpleCode>, this strategy can initiate SSO for the users.

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  name="connectionId"
  id="connectionId"
  placeholder="conn_12434243"
  className="text-black block w-full border bord<<truncated>>"
  value={state.connectionId}
  onChange={handleChange}
  required
/>
```

The code examples contain <SimpleCode>name</SimpleCode>, <SimpleCode>id</SimpleCode> attributes that lets your B2B app inform authentication strategy to choose.

## Initiate Authentication

Next, redirect the user to the Authorization URL.

Upon submitting the form, the <SimpleCode>initateAuth</SimpleCode> method is invoked and options required to construct the Authorization URL passed to <SimpleCode>getAuthorizationUrl()</SimpleCode> method. This guide provides a concise overview. For in-depth information on the required options, continue reading the Authorization URL section.

```jsx title="app/login/page.tsx"
const handleChange = (e: FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>): void => {
  const { name, value } = e.currentTarget;
  setState({
    ...state,
    [name]: value,
  });
};

const initiateAuth = async (event: FormEvent) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const url = await getAuthorizationUrl({ ...state });
  router.push(url);
};
```

Since these operations happen the browser side we secure our app through industry best practices as follows:

```jsx title="app/actions/login.ts"
export async function getAuthorizationUrl(option: Option) {
  const { connectionId } = option;
  const state = v4();
  cookies().set({
    name: 'state',
    value: state,
    httpOnly: true, // Prevents Cross Site Scripting attacks
    path: '/',
  })
  return scalekit.getAuthorizationUrl(
    process.env.AUTH_REDIRECT_URI!,
    {
     state: state, // CSRF protection or any other state you want to pass
     connectionId: connectionId ? connectionId : process.env.AUTH_CONNECTION_ID!
    }
  );
}
```

The <SimpleCode>getAuthorizationUrl()</SimpleCode> will return a URL string value similar to:

```sh
https://b2b-app-dev.scalekit.dev/oauth/authorize?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=skc_1234&
    scope=openid%20profile&
    redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fyoursaas.com%2Fcallback&
    organization_id=org_1243412&
    state=aHR0cHM6Ly95b3Vyc2Fhcy5jb20vZGVlcGxpbms%3D
```

## Next steps

Now that users are successfully redirected for authentication, your B2B app needs to understand their roles and permissions. This is where handling user profiles becomes crucial. Let's explore how to gather and utilize user details effectively. Keep reading on Handle User Profile to continue building your secure B2B application.
